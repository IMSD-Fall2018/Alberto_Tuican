The Founder looks to be a game about creating a tech startup, and how to manage it while competing against the current market and creating new technologies. The game gives an interesting perspective to running a startup, especially with how to manage employees and the market. Specifically for me, it makes me understand why companies are so unwilling to hire on new employees, what with all the costs they currently have to manage; adding on more employees only increases those costs, and can make it harder to break even. I also now understand why companies rarely hire someone who's overqualified, because it usually means having to pay them more for their services.

Given all that, I don't necessarily agree with how the game shows the market, especially being a student actively searching for a job. I agree that it's a great game for showing how a startup might deal with various situations, but I'm not sure it accurately represents the hiring aspect of the market. But regardless, the game puts a lot of things in perspective and more people should play it; I won't say if there's hidden meanings or metaphors cause I don't personally see them.

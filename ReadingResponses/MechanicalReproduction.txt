Walter Benjamin touches on a couple key points about art, pertaining to how it functions in the age where everything is mechanically reproduced. He talks about aura, which is how authentic an artpiece can be, and how the aura can get lost as it's reproduced. In terms of digital media, it depends on if the media is of existing art or something new; for film or pictures representing art, they have no aura as they are copies of the art and not original. In the case of digital drawings and such, they still retain aura as they're original works created by individuals and groups of individuals. Games are a complicated equation, a mixture of original and existing art, and of authority on what part of the art is to be seen. If a game is completely original but includes another's music, it can still retain an aura as it comprises an original work.
